  abstract = {The accuracy of optical flow estimation algorithms has been improving steadily as evidenced by results on the Middlebury optical flow benchmark. The typical formulation, however, has changed little since the work of Horn and Schunck. We attempt to uncover what has made recent advances possible through a thorough analysis of how the objective function, the optimization method, and modern implementation practices influence accuracy. We discover that &#x201C;classical&#x201D; flow formulations perform surprisingly well when combined with modern optimization and implementation techniques. Moreover, we find that while median filtering of intermediate flow fields during optimization is a key to recent performance gains, it leads to higher energy solutions. To understand the principles behind this phenomenon, we derive a new objective that formalizes the median filtering heuristic. This objective includes a nonlocal term that robustly integrates flow estimates over large spatial neighborhoods. By modifying this new term to include information about flow and image boundaries we develop a method that ranks at the top of the Middlebury benchmark.},

  abstract = {Optical flow is a critical component of video editing applications, e.g. for tasks such as object tracking, segmentation, and selection. In this paper, we propose an optical flow algorithm called SimpleFlow whose running times increase sublinearly in the number of pixels. Central to our approach is a probabilistic representation of the motion flow that is computed using only local evidence and without resorting to global optimization. To estimate the flow in image regions where the motion is smooth, we use a sparse set of samples only, thereby avoiding the expensive computation inherent in traditional dense algorithms. We show that our results can be used as is for a variety of video editing tasks. For applications where accuracy is paramount, we use our result to bootstrap a global optimization. This significantly reduces the running times of such methods without sacrificing accuracy. We also demonstrate that the SimpleFlow algorithm can process HD and 4K footage in reasonable times.},

  abstract = {Most approaches for estimating optical flow assume that, within a finite image region, only a single motion is present. Thissingle motion assumptionis violated in common situations involving transparency, depth discontinuities, independently moving objects, shadows, and specular reflections. To robustly estimate optical flow, the single motion assumption must be relaxed. This paper presents a framework based onrobust estimationthat addresses violations of the brightness constancy and spatial smoothness assumptions caused by multiple motions. We show how therobust estimation frameworkcan be applied to standard formulations of the optical flow problem thus reducing their sensitivity to violations of their underlying assumptions. The approach has been applied to three standard techniques for recovering optical flow: area-based regression, correlation, and regularization with motion discontinuities. This paper focuses on the recovery of multiple parametric motion models within a region, as well as the recovery of piecewise-smooth flow fields, and provides examples with natural and synthetic image sequences.},

However, if based on the grey value constancy assumption only, such techniques are not robust enough to cope with typical illumination changes in real-world data. In our paper we tackle this problem in two ways: First we discuss different photometric invariants for the design of illumination-robust variational optical flow methods. These invariants are based on colour information and include such concepts as spherical/conical transforms, normalisation strategies and the differentiation of logarithms. Secondly, we embed them into a suitable multichannel generalisation of the highly accurate variational optical flow technique of Brox },

  abstract = {Optical flow is widely in use in the field of image processing. In general, optical flow is computed from luminance images. However, optical flow based on luminance information highly depends on moving shadows, varying shading and moving specularities due to camera movement, and fluctuations in the light source intensity. In this paper, we propose a novel method to compute optical flow based on photometric invariants. A major drawback of photometric invariants and their derivatives is that they are unstable for certain RGB values. Therefore, we study on photometric invariant derivatives and noise propagation yielding a condence measure indicating the stability of the corresponding photometric invariant derivatives. This condence measure is integrated into the optical flow framework to provide robustness against noisy data. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms optical flow estimation that does not take the instability of the invariants into account.},

@article{HarmonyFlow,
  abstract = {Most variational optic flow approaches just consist of three constituents: a data term, a smoothness term and a smoothness weight. In this paper, we present an approach that harmonises these three components. We start by developing an advanced data term that is robust under outliers and varying illumination conditions. This is achieved by using constraint normalisation, and an HSV colour representation with higher order constancy assumptions and a separate robust penalisation. Our novel anisotropic smoothness is designed to work complementary to the data term. To this end, it incorporates directional information from the data constraints to enable a filling-in of information solely in the direction where the data term gives no information, yielding an optimal complementary smoothing behaviour. This strategy is applied in the spatial as well as in the spatio-temporal domain. Finally, we propose a simple method for automatically determining the optimal smoothness weight. This method bases on a novel concept that we call “optimal prediction principle” (OPP). It states that the flow field obtained with the optimal smoothness weight allows for the best prediction of the next frames in the image sequence. The benefits of our “optic flow in harmony” (OFH) approach are demonstrated by an extensive experimental validation and by a competitive performance at the widely used Middlebury optic flow benchmark.},

Specific topics in early vision and their regularization are then analyzed rigorously, characterizing existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions. A fundamental difficulty that arises in almost every vision problem is scale, that is, the resolution at which to operate. Methods that have been proposed to deal with the problem include scale-space techniques that consider the behavior of the result across a continuum of scales. From the point of view of regulation theory, the concept of scale is related quite directly to the regularization parameter &lambda;. It suggested that methods used to obtained the optimal value of &lambda; may provide, either directly or after suitable modification, the optimal scale associated with the specific instance of certain problems},

@article{Bruhn2006,
  abstract = {Variational methods are among the most accurate techniques for estimating the optic flow. They yield dense flow fields and can be designed such that they preserve discontinuities, estimate large displacements correctly and perform well under noise and varying illumination. However, such adaptations render the minimisation of the underlying energy functional very expensive in terms of computational costs: Typically one or more large linear or nonlinear equation systems have to be solved in order to obtain the desired solution. Consequently, variational methods are considered to be too slow for real-time performance. In our paper we address this problem in two ways: (i) We present a numerical framework based on bidirectional multigrid methods for accelerating a broad class of variational optic flow methods with different constancy and smoothness assumptions. Thereby, our work focuses particularly on regularisation strategies that preserve discontinuities. (ii) We show by the examples of five classical and two recent variational techniques that real-time performance is possible in all cases—even for very complex optic flow models that offer high accuracy. Experiments show that frame rates up to 63 dense flow fields per second for image sequences of size 160 × 120 can be achieved on a standard PC. Compared to classical iterative methods this constitutes a speedup of two to four orders of magnitude.},

@article{Lai98,
  abstract = {In this paper, we present two very efficient and accurate algorithms for computing optical flow. The first is a modified gradient-based regularization method, and the other is an SSD-based regularization method. For the gradient-based method, to amend the errors in the discrete image flow equation caused by numerical differentiation as well as temporal and spatial aliasing in the brightness function, we propose to selectively combine the image flow constraint and a contour-based flow constraint into the data constraint by using a reliability measure. Each data constraint is appropriately normalized to obtain an approximate minimum distance (of the data point to the linear flow equation) constraint instead of the conventional linear flow constraint. These modifications lead to robust and accurate optical flow estimation. We propose an incomplete Cholesky preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to solve the resulting large and sparse linear system efficiently. Our SSD-based regularization method uses a normalized SSD measure (based on a similar reasoning as in the gradient-based scheme) as the data constraint in a regularization framework. The nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm in conjunction with an incomplete Cholesky preconditioning is developed to solve the resulting nonlinear minimization problem. Experimental results on synthetic and real image sequences for these two algorithms are given to demonstrate their performance in comparison with competing methods reported in literature.},

In most situations, the mere gray value variations do not provide sufficient information in order to estimate such a displacement vector field. Supplementary constraints are necessary, for example the postulate that a displacement vector field varies smoothly as a function of the image position. Taken as a general requirement, this creates difficulties at gray value transitions which correspond to occluding contours. Nagel therefore introduced the ``oriented smoothness'' requirement which restricts variations of the displacement vector field only in directions with small or no variation of gray values. This contribution reports results of an investigation about how such an ``oriented smoothness'' constraint may be formulated and evaluated.},

Our method leads to a rotationally invariant and time symmetric convex optimization problem. It has a unique minimum that can be found in a stable way by standard algorithms such as gradient descent. Since the convexity guarantees global convergence, the result does not depend on the flow initialization. Two iterative algorithms are presented that are not difficult to implement. Qualitative and quantitative results for synthetic and real-world scenes show that our spatio-temporal approach (i) improves optic flow fields significantly, (ii) smoothes out background noise efficiently, and (iii) preserves true motion boundaries.

  abstract = {Abstract. Assumptions of brightness constancy and spatial smoothness underlie most optical flow estimation methods. In contrast to standard heuristic formulations, we learn a statistical model of both brightness constancy error and the spatial properties of optical flow using image sequences with associated ground truth flow fields. The result is a complete probabilistic model of optical flow. Specifically, the ground truth enables us to model how the assumption of brightness constancy is violated in naturalistic sequences, resulting in a probabilistic model of ?brightness inconstancy?. We also generalize previous high-order constancy assumptions, such as gradient constancy, by modeling the constancy of responses to various linear filters in a high-order random field framework. These filters are free variables that can be learned from training data. Additionally we study the spatial structure of the optical flow and how motion boundaries are related to image intensity boundaries. Spatial smoothness is modeled using a Steerable Random Field, where spatial derivatives of the optical flow are steered by the image brightness structure. These models provide a statistical motivation for previous methods and enable the learning of all parameters from training data. All proposed models are quantitatively compared on the Middlebury flow dataset. 1},

Previously, there have only been heuristic discussions on how to choose the smoothing parameter.

  abstract = {New X-ray sources of unmatched brilliance, like the superconducting undulator device at ESRF high-energy beamline ID15A, allow for micro-radioscopic investigations with time-resolution up to the micro-second range. Here we present first results of two recent in situ experiments: the visualization of semi-solid metal flow at an acquisition speed 500 frames/s (fps) and the collapse of pore walls in liquid metallic foams investigated at 40,000 fps. Both applications reveal important qualitative and quantitative facts about the dynamic processes in liquid and/or semi-solid metals which were inaccessible until now because of either the limited spatial and/or the limited time-resolution of conventional X-ray devices. Thus, semi-solid slurry is observed to break into small particle clusters when injected at high speed. The event of cell wall collapse in metal foams is found to take ~1?2 ms time, indicating that the dynamics of this system is inertia controlled.},

Bending magnets and insertion devices of third generation synchrotron light sources offer a polychromatic photon flux density which is high enough to perform hard X-ray imaging with a spatio-temporal resolution up to the ?m-?s range. Existing indirect X-ray image detectors commonly used at synchrotron light sources can be adapted for fast image acquisition by employing CMOS-based digital high speed cameras already available on the market.

  abstract = {A novel image-processing procedure is proposed for the analysis of sequences of two-dimensional projection images. Sudden events like the merging of bubbles in an evolving foam can be detected and spatio-temporally located in a given projection image sequence. The procedure is based on optical flow computations extended by a forward-backward check for each time step. Compared with prior methods, efficient suppression of noise or false events is achieved owing to uniform foam motion, and the reliability of detection is thus increased. The applicability of the proposed procedure in combination with synchrotron radiography is illustrated by a series of characteristic studies of foams of different kind. First, the detection of single-bubble collapses in aqueous foams is considered. Second, a spatial distribution of coalescence events in metals foamed in casting molds is estimated. Finally, the structural stability of polymer foams containing admixed solid nanoparticles is examined.},

  abstract = {Semi-solid melts exhibit a very unpredictable rheology and filling dynamics, when injected into thin-walled components. Optimization of the process requires an insight into the casting process during injection. For this purpose we injected semi-solid an Al?Ge alloy into two different thin channel geometries while recording high resolution radiographs at fast frame rates (up to 1000 images per s). Comparison of a bottleneck channel, which has previously been used for slower experiments, with a right-angle turn geometry reveals a significant influence of the channel shape on the flow behaviour of the particle?liquid mixture. While the bottleneck is quickly sealed with densified solid, turbulences in the right-angle turn apparently permit solid particles and clusters to move conjointly with the liquid and thus achieve a more complete filling. Single particle trajectories and rapid break-up of solid skeletons in such a system have been observed for the first time in situ.},

@article{Bruhn05a,
  abstract = {Differential methods belong to the most widely used techniques for optic flow computation in image sequences. They can be classified into local methods such as the Lucas?Kanade technique or Bigün's structure tensor method, and into global methods such as the Horn/Schunck approach and its extensions. Often local methods are more robust under noise, while global techniques yield dense flow fields. The goal of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding and the design of novel differential methods in four ways; (i) We juxtapose the role of smoothing/regularisation processes that are required in local and global differential methods for optic flow computation. (ii) This discussion motivates us to describe and evaluate a novel method that combines important advantages of local and global approaches: It yields dense flow fields that are robust against noise. (iii) Spatiotemporal and nonlinear extensions as well as multiresolution frameworks are presented for this hybrid method. (iv) We propose a simple confidence measure for optic flow methods that minimise energy functionals. It allows to sparsify a dense flow field gradually, depending on the reliability required for the resulting flow. Comparisons with experiments from the literature demonstrate the favourable performance of the proposed methods and the confidence measure.},

  abstract = {This paper presents results from computer experiments with an algorithm to perform scene disposition and motion segmentation from visual motion or optic flow. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion is used to formulate what the best segmentation or interpretation of the scene should be, where the scene is assumed to be made up of some fixed number of moving planar surface patches. The Bayesian approach requires, first, specification of prior expectations for the optic flow field, which here is modeled as spatial and temporal Markov random fields; and, secondly, a way of measuring how well the segmentation predicts the measured flow field. The Markov random fields incorporate the physical constraints that objects and their images are probably spatially continuous, and that their images are likely to move quite smoothly across the image plane. To compute the flow predicted by the segmentation, a recent method for reconstructing the motion and orientation of planar surface facets is used. The search for the globally optimal segmentation is performed using simulated annealing.},

  abstract = {We present a technique for the computation of 2D component velocity from image sequences. Initially, the image sequence is represented by a family of spatiotemporal velocity-tuned linear filters. Component velocity, computed from spatiotemporal responses of identically tuned filters, is expressed in terms of the local first-order behavior of surfaces of constant phase. Justification for this definition is discussed from the perspectives of both 2D image translation and deviations from translation that are typical in perspective projections of 3D scenes. The resulting technique is predominantly linear, efficient, and suitable for parallel processing. Moreover, it is local in space-time, robust with respect to noise, and permits multiple estimates within a single neighborhood. Promising quantiative results are reported from experiments with realistic image sequences, including cases with sizeable perspective deformation.},

We present a new image registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity gradient of the images to find a good match using a type of Newton-Raphson iteration. Our technique is taster because it examines far fewer potential matches between the images than existing techniques Furthermore, this registration technique can be generalized to handle rotation, scaling and shearing. We show how our technique can be adapted tor use in a stereo vision system.},

@article{Papenberg06,
  abstract = {In this paper, we suggest a variational model for optic flow computation based on non-linearised and higher order constancy assumptions. Besides the common grey value constancy assumption, also gradient constancy, as well as the constancy of the Hessian and the Laplacian are proposed. Since the model strictly refrains from a linearisation of these assumptions, it is also capable to deal with large displacements. For the minimisation of the rather complex energy functional, we present an efficient numerical scheme employing two nested fixed point iterations. Following a coarse-to-fine strategy it turns out that there is a theoretical foundation of so-called warping techniques hitherto justified only on an experimental basis. Since our algorithm consists of the integration of various concepts, ranging from different constancy assumptions to numerical implementation issues, a detailed account of the effect of each of these concepts is included in the experimental section. The superior performance of the proposed method shows up by significantly smaller estimation errors when compared to previous techniques. Further experiments also confirm excellent robustness under noise and insensitivity to parameter variations.},

The authors start by formulating constraints on image motion to account for the possibility of multiple motions. This is achieved by exploiting the notions of weak continuity and robust statistics in the formulation of a minimization problem. The resulting objective function is non-convex. Traditional stochastic relaxation techniques for minimizing such functions prove inappropriate for the task. A highly parallel incremental stochastic minimization algorithm is presented which has a number of advantages over previous approaches. The incremental nature of the scheme makes it dynamic and permits the detection of occlusion and disocclusion boundaries},

  abstract = {Although variational methods are among the most accurate techniques for estimating the optical flow, they have not yet entered the field of real-time vision. Main reason is the great popularity of standard numerical schemes that are easy to implement, however, at the expense of being too slow for real-time performance. In our paper we address this problem in two ways: (i) we present an improved version of the highly accurate technique of Brox et al. (2004). Thereby we show that a separate robustification of the constancy assumptions is very useful, in particular if the I-norm is used as penalizer. As a result, a method is obtained that yields the lowest angular errors in the literature, (ii) We develop an efficient numerical scheme for the proposed approach that allows real-time performance for sequences of size 160 &times; 720. To this end, we combine two hierarchical strategies: a coarse-to-fine warping strategy as implementation of a fixed point iteration for a non-convex optimisation problem and a nonlinear full multigrid method - a so called full approximation scheme (FAS) - for solving the highly nonlinear equation systems at each warping level. In the experimental section the advantage of the proposed approach becomes obvious: Outperforming standard numerical schemes by two orders of magnitude frame rates of six high quality flow fields per second are obtained on a 3.06 GHz Pentium4 PC.},

This framework encompasses a broad range of transformations including stereo, optical flow, lighting changes, blur, and combinations of these effects. Parametric models such as affine motion, vignetting, and radial distortion can also be modeled within the same framework. All such transformations are modeled by selecting a number of constraints and objectives on the filter entries from a catalog which we enumerate. Most of the constraints are linear, leading to globally optimal solutions (via linear programming) for affine transformations, depth-from-defocus, and other problems. Adding a (non-convex) compactness objective enables solutions for optical flow with illumination changes, spacevariant defocus, and higher-order smoothness. 1.},

  abstract = {To compute reliable dense depth maps, a stereo algorithm must preserve depth discontinuities and avoid gross errors. In this paper, we show how simple and parallel techniques can be combined to achieve this goal and deal with complex real world scenes. Our algorithm relies on correlation followed by interpolation. During the correlation phase the two images play a symmetric role and we use a validity criterion for the matches that eliminate gross errors: at places where the images cannot be correlated reliably, due to lack of texture of occlusions for example, the algorithm does not produce wrong matches but a very sparse disparity map as opposed to a dense one when the correlation is successful. To generate a dense depth map, the information is then propagated across the featureless areas, but not across discontinuities, by an interpolation scheme that takes image grey levels into account to preserve image features. We show that our algorithm performs very well on difficult images such as faces and cluttered ground level scenes. Because all the algorithms described here are parallel and very regular they could be implemented in hardware and lead to extremely fast stereo systems.},

In addition to accelerated convergence toward good estimates, it allows to mix different parameterizations of the estimate relative to adaptive partitions of the image. The performances of the resulting algorithms are demonstrated in the difficult context of a non-convex energy. Experimental results on real world Meteosat sequences are presented},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the usefulness of bidirectional multigrid methods for variational optical flow computations. Although these numerical schemes are among the fastest methods for solving equation systems, they are rarely applied in the field of computer vision. We demonstrate how to employ those numerical methods for the treatment of variational optical flow formulations and show that the efficiency of this approach even allows for real-time performance on standard PCs. As a representative for variational optic flow methods, we consider the recently introduced combined local-global method. It can be considered as a noise-robust generalization of the Horn and Schunck technique. We present a decoupled, as well as a coupled, version of the classical Gau&szlig;-Seidel solver, and we develop several multigrid implementations based on a discretization coarse grid approximation. In contrast, with standard bidirectional multigrid algorithms, we take advantage of intergrid transfer operators that allow for nondyadic grid hierarchies. As a consequence, no restrictions concerning the image size or the number of traversed levels have to be imposed. In the experimental section, we juxtapose the developed multigrid schemes and demonstrate their superior performance when compared to unidirectional multigrid methods and nonhierachical solvers. For the well-known 316&times;252 Yosemite sequence, we succeeded in computing the complete set of dense flow fields in three quarters of a second on a 3.06-GHz Pentium4 PC. This corresponds to a frame rate of 18 flow fields per second which outperforms the widely-used Gau&szlig;-Seidel method by almost three orders of magnitude.},

The goal of our work is to develop a framework for recovering general shape from such distortions when the environment is neither calibrated nor known. To achieve this goal we consider far-field illumination, where the object-environment distance is relatively large, and we examine the dense specular flow that is induced on the image plane through relative object-environment motion. We show that under these very practical conditions the observed specular flow can be related to surface shape through a pair of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. Importantly, this relationship depends only on the environment's relative motion and not its content. We examine the qualitative properties of these equations, present analytic methods for recovery of the shape in several special cases, and empirically validate our results using captured data. We also discuss the relevance to both computer vision and human perception.},

In this paper, we describe a new optical flow scheme containing three phases. First, we partition the input images and integrate the segmentation information into a variational model where each of the segments is constrained by an affine motion. Then the errors brought in by segmentation are measured and stored in a confidence map. The final flow estimation is achieved through a global optimization phase that minimizes an energy function incorporating the confidence map. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method not only produces quantitatively accurate optical flow estimates but also preserves sharp motion boundaries, which makes the optical flow result usable in a number of computer vision applications, such as image/video segmentation and editing.},

  abstract = {  In particular in medical imaging, registration schemes are known to be valuable tools in various settings, like, e.g., the comparison of pre- and post biopsy images. The currently available schemes in can roughly be divided in two classes: landmark based and intensity based registration schemes. In this paper, we present a rigorous mathematical framework for combining these two techniques, in order to benefit from the advantages of both strategies. Intensity based approaches aim to match images by minimizing an appropriate distance measure, like, e.g., the L2-norm of the difference image or the mutual information of the two images. These techniques are generally full automatic and yield a good registration on the average. However, they may perform poorly for specific, important locations like anatomical landmarks. On the opposite, landmark based registration techniques are designed to accurately match user specified landmarks. A drawback of landmark based registration is the fact that the intensities of the images are completely neglected. Consequently, the registration result away from the landmarks may be very poor. Here, we propose a mathematical framework for combining any distance measure based registration with landmark information. We also present a general numerical procedure for computing the wanted transformation as well as a particular implementation for a specific distance measure based registration technique. The general procedure computes a displacement field which is mathematically guaranteed to produce a one-to-one match between given landmarks and at the same time to minimize an intensity based measure for the remaining parts of the images. The properties of the new scheme are demonstrated for a variety of examples. It is},

  abstract = {A novel optical flow estimation process based on a spatio-temporal model with varying coefficients multiplying a set of basis functions at each pixel is introduced. Previous optical flow estimation methodologies did not use such an over parameterized representation of the flow field as the problem is ill-posed even without introducing any additional parameters: Neighborhood based methods of the Lucas---Kanade type determine the flow at each pixel by constraining the flow to be described by a few parameters in small neighborhoods. Modern variational methods represent the optic flow directly via the flow field components at each pixel. The benefit of over-parametrization becomes evident in the smoothness term, which instead of directly penalizing for changes in the optic flow, accumulates a cost of deviating from the assumed optic flow model. Our proposed method is very general and the classical variational optical flow techniques are special cases of it, when used in conjunction with constant basis functions. Experimental results with the novel flow estimation process yield significant improvements with respect to the best results published so far.},

A new approach for dealing with these issues is presented. It is based on the use of a probabilistic mixture model to explicitly represent multiple motions within a patch. A simple extension of the EM-algorithm is used to compute a maximum likelihood estimate for the various motion parameters.

The discontinuities in the description are then attributed to object opacities rather than to the flow itself, mirroring the structure of the scene. A set of techniques is devised for segmenting images into coherently moving regions using affine motion analysis and clustering techniques. It is possible to decompose an image into a set of layers along with information about occlusion and depth ordering. The techniques are applied to a flower garden sequence.

@article{Bruhn06b,
  abstract = {Variational methods are among the most accurate techniques for estimating the optic flow. They yield dense flow fields and can be designed such that they preserve discontinuities, estimate large displacements correctly and perform well under noise and varying illumination. However, such adaptations render the minimisation of the underlying energy functional very expensive in terms of computational costs: Typically one or more large linear or nonlinear equation systems have to be solved in order to obtain the desired solution. Consequently, variational methods are considered to be too slow for real-time performance. In our paper we address this problem in two ways: (i) We present a numerical framework based on bidirectional multigrid methods for accelerating a broad class of variational optic flow methods with different constancy and smoothness assumptions. Thereby, our work focuses particularly on regularisation strategies that preserve discontinuities. (ii) We show by the examples of five classical and two recent variational techniques that real-time performance is possible in all cases?even for very complex optic flow models that offer high accuracy. Experiments show that frame rates up to 63 dense flow fields per second for image sequences of size 160 × 120 can be achieved on a standard PC. Compared to classical iterative methods this constitutes a speedup of two to four orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {A method is presented for measuring 3-D plant growth using the optical flow computed on an image sequence of a growing corn seedling. Each image in the sequence consists of two views of the same seedling; one view of the corn seedling is front-on while the second view is a orthogonal view (at 90°) of the seedling made by projecting the plant's orthogonal image onto a mirror oriented at 45° with respect to the camera. We compute 3-D velocity (motion) of the corn seedling's tip by using a simple extension of the 2-D motion constraint equation used in optical flow analysis. This method is an extension of the work presented by Barron and Liptay where optical flow was used to measure the 2-D growth (in the vertical plane) of a corn seedling.},

Only a small subset of the suggested algorithms have been analyzed with respect to their performance. These evaluations were based on black-box tests, mainly yielding information on the average accuracy on test-sequences with ground truth. No theoretically sound justification exists on why this approach meaningfully and/or exhaustively describes the properties of optical flow algorithms. In practice, design choices are often made based on unmotivated criteria or by trial and error. This article is a position paper questioning current methods in performance analysis. Without empirical results, we discuss more rigorous and theoretically sound approaches which could enable scientists and engineers alike to make sufficiently motivated design choices for a given motion estimation task.},

Since it is invariant under monotonically increasing grey value transformations, it forms the basis of an illumination-robust constancy assumption. However, its underlying mathematical concepts have not been studied so far. The goal of our paper is to provide this missing theoretical foundation. We study the continuous limit of the inherently discrete census transform and embed it into a variational setting. Our analysis shows two surprising results: The census-based technique enforces matchings of extrema, and it induces an anisotropy in the data term by acting along level lines. Last but not least, we establish links to the widely-used gradient constancy assumption and present experiments that confirm our findings.},

The root signals and noise attenuation properties of the FIR-median hybrid filters are analyzed and compared to representative edge preserving filtering operations. The concept of multilevel median operation is introduced to improve the detail preserving property of conventional median and the FIR-median hybrid filters. In the multilevel filters there exists a tradeoff between noise attenuation and detail preservation. The analysis and examples indicate that FIR-median hybrid filters preserve details better and are computationally much more efficient than the conventional median and the K-nearest neighbor averaging filters.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we focus on techniques for vector-valued image regularization, based on variational methods and PDEs. Starting from the study of PDE-based formalisms previously proposed in the literature for the regularization of scalar and vector-valued data, we propose a unifying expression that gathers the majority of these previous frameworks into a single generic anisotropic diffusion equation. On one hand, the resulting expression provides a simple interpretation of the regularization process in terms of local filtering with spatially adaptive Gaussian kernels. On the other hand, it naturally disassembles any regularization scheme into the smoothing process itself and the underlying geometry that drives the smoothing. Thus, we can easily specialize our generic expression into different regularization PDEs that fulfill desired smoothing behaviors, depending on the considered application: image restoration, inpainting, magnification, flow visualization, etc. Specific numerical schemes are also proposed, allowing us to implement our regularization framework with accuracy by taking the local filtering properties of the proposed equations into account. Finally, we illustrate the wide range of applications handled by our selected anisotropic diffusion equations with application results on color images.},

It combines gray levels or colors based on both their geometric closeness and their photometric similarity, and prefers near values to distant values in both domain and range. In contrast with filters that operate on the three bands of a color image separately, a bilateral filter can enforce the perceptual metric underlying the CIE-Lab color space, and smooth colors and preserve edges in a way that is tuned to human perception. Also, in contrast with standard filtering, bilateral filtering produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors where they appear in the original image},

  abstract = {We present results from a user study that compared six visualization methods for two-dimensional vector data. Users performed three simple but representative tasks using visualizations from each method: 1) locating all critical points in an image, 2) identifying critical point types, and 3) advecting a particle. Visualization methods included two that used different spatial distributions of short arrow icons, two that used different distributions of integral curves, one that used wedges located to suggest flow lines, and line-integral convolution (LIC). Results show different strengths and weaknesses for each method. We found that users performed these tasks better with methods that: 1) showed the sign of vectors within the vector field, 2) visually represented integral curves, and 3) visually represented the locations of critical points. Expert user performance was not statistically different from nonexpert user performance. We used several methods to analyze the data including omnibus analysis of variance, pairwise t-tests, and graphical analysis using inferential confidence intervals. We concluded that using the inferential confidence intervals for displaying the overall pattern of results for each task measure and for performing subsequent pairwise comparisons of the condition means was the best method for analyzing the data in this study. These results provide quantitative support for some of the anecdotal evidence concerning visualization methods. The tasks and testing framework also provide a basis for comparing other visualization methods, for creating more effective methods and for defining additional tasks to further understand the tradeoffs among the methods. In the future, we also envision extending this work to more ambitious comparisons, such as evaluating two-dimensional vectors on two-dimensional surfaces embedded in three-dimensional space and defining analogous tasks for three-dimensional visualization methods.},

  abstract = {The goal of this article is to review the state-of-the-art tracking methods, classify them into different categories, and identify new trends. Object tracking, in general, is a challenging problem. Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion, changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene, nonrigid object structures, object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions, and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically, assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application. In this survey, we categorize the tracking methods on the basis of the object and motion representations used, provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category, and examine their pros and cons. Moreover, we discuss the important issues related to tracking including the use of appropriate image features, selection of motion models, and detection of objects.},

The evolving contours naturally split and merge, allowing the simultaneous detection of several objects and both interior and exterior boundaries. The proposed approach is based on the relation between active contours and the computation of geodesics or minimal distance curves. The minimal distance curve lays in a Riemannian space whose metric as defined by the image content. This geodesic approach for object segmentation allows to connect classical &ldquo;snakes&rdquo; based on energy minimization and geometric active contours based on the theory of curve evolution. Previous models of geometric active contours are improved as showed by a number of examples. Formal results concerning existence, uniqueness, stability, and correctness of the evolution are presented as well},

@article{Canny86,
  abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

@article{Brown92,
  abstract = {Registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to match two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints. Virtually all large systems which evaluate images require the registration of images, or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific examples of systems where image registration is a significant component include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images, matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation, and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis.Over the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for various types of data and problems.   These techniques have been independently studied for several different applications, resulting in a large body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship between the variations in the images and the type of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied. Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken. The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values, but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The third type of variations are differences in the images that are of interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes. Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed by registration, but they make registration more difficult since an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of feature space, similarity measure, search space,   and  search strategy which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem.},

The registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images). The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (areabased and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too.

@article{Parker83,
  abstract = {When resampling an image to a new set of coordinates (for example, when rotating an image), there is often a noticeable loss in image quality. To preserve image quality, the interpolating function used for the resampling should be an ideal low-pass filter. To determine which limited extent convolving functions would provide the best interpolation, five functions were compared: A) nearest neighbor, B) linear, C) cubic B-spline, D) high-resolution cubic spline with edge enhancement (a = -1), and E) high-resolution cubic spline (a = -0.5). The functions which extend over four picture elements (C, D, E) were shown to have a better frequency response than those which extend over one (A) or two (B) pixels. The nearest neighbor function shifted the image up to one-half a pixel. Linear and cubic B-spline interpolation tended to smooth the image. The best response was obtained with the high-resolution cubic spline functions. The location of the resampled points with respect to the initial coordinate system has a dramatic effect on the response of the sampled interpolating function??the data are exactly reproduced when the points are aligned, and the response has the most smoothing when the resampled points are equidistant from the original coordinate points. Thus, at the expense of some increase in computing time, image quality can be improved by resampled using the high-resolution cubic spline function as compared to the nearest neighbor, linear, or cubic B-spline functions.},

@article{Grevera98,
  abstract = {To aid in the display, manipulation, and analysis of biomedical image data, they usually need to be converted to data of isotropic discretization through the process of interpolation. Traditional techniques consist of direct interpolation of the grey values. When user interaction is called for in image segmentation, as a consequence of these interpolation methods, the user needs to segment a much greater (typically 4-10&times;) amount of data. To mitigate this problem, a method called shape-based interpolation of binary data was developed. Resides significantly reducing user time, this method has been shown to provide more accurate results than grey-level interpolation. The authors proposed an approach for the interpolation of grey data of arbitrary dimensionality that generalized the shape-based method from binary to grey data. This method has characteristics similar to those of the binary shape-based method. In particular, the authors showed preliminary evidence that it produced more accurate results than conventional grey-level interpolation methods. In this paper, concentrating on the three-dimensional (3-D) interpolation problem, the authors compare statistically the accuracy of 8 different methods: nearest-neighbor, linear grey-level, grey-level cubic spline, grey-level modified cubic spline, Goshtasby et al. (1992), and 3 methods from the grey-level shape-based class. A population of patient magnetic resonance and computed tomography images, corresponding to different parts of the human anatomy, coming from different 3-D imaging applications, are utilized for comparison. Each slice in these data sets is estimated by each interpolation method and compared to the original slice at the same location using 3 measures: mean-squared difference, number of sites of disagreement, and largest difference. The methods are statistically compared pairwise based on these measures. The shape-based methods statistically significantly outperformed all other methods in all - - measures in all applications considered here with a statistical relevance ranging from 10% to 32% (mean=15%) for mean-squared difference.},

Cells bring about changes in embryonic form by generating patterned forces and by differentiating the tissue mechanical properties that harness these forces in specific ways. Therefore, biomechanics lies at the core of connecting the genetic and molecular basis of cell activities to the macroscopic tissue deformations that shape the embryo. Here we discuss what is known of the biomechanics of gastrulation, primarily in amphibians but also comparing similar morphogenic processes in teleost fish and amniotes, and selected events in several species invertebrates.

Fluorescence light-sheet microscopy bridges the gap in image quality between fluorescence stereomicroscopy and high-resolution imaging of fixed tissue sections. In addition, high depth penetration, low bleaching and high acquisition speeds make light-sheet microscopy ideally suited for extended time-lapse experiments in live embryos. This review compares the benefits and challenges of light-sheet microscopy with established fluorescence microscopy techniques such as confocal microscopy and discusses the different implementations and applications of this easily adaptable technology.},

Multiview in vivo imaging at 1.5 billion voxels per minute provides "digital embryos," that is, comprehensive databases of cell positions, divisions, and migratory tracks. Our analysis of global cell division patterns reveals a maternally defined initial morphodynamic symmetry break, which identifies the embryonic body axis.

Here, we report on the use of microscopic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to directly follow morphogenetic movements during blastula and gastrula stages of the Xenopus laevis embryo. We compare three different MRI modalities that take advantage of the intrinsic contrast present in embryonic tissues: three-dimensional (3D) fat-imaging, 3D water-imaging, and 2D high-speed high-resolution imaging of early embryonic stages. We show that the features revealed by the intrinsic contrast correlate with the histological structure of the embryo. Using this tissue specific intrinsic contrast, the main embryonic tissues and internal tissue movements as well as archenteron invagination can be differentiated without cell labeling. We present 2D and 3D time-lapse sequences of early Xenopus embryonic development, spanning the stages from early blastula to the end of gastrula, which show the complex internal rearrangements of gastrulation in essentially real-time.},

Here we provide a detailed protocol for applying this technique to study gastrulation in Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog) embryos. In contrast to μMRI, XPCμT images optically opaque embryos with subminute temporal and micrometer-range spatial resolution. We describe sample preparation, culture and suspension of embryos, tomographic imaging with a typical duration of 2 h (gastrulation and neurulation stages), intricacies of image pre-processing, phase retrieval, tomographic reconstruction, segmentation and motion analysis. Moreover, we briefly discuss our present understanding of X-ray dose effects (heat load and radiolysis), and we outline how to optimize the experimental configuration with respect to X-ray energy, photon flux density, sample-detector distance, exposure time per tomographic projection, numbers of projections and time-lapse intervals. The protocol requires an interdisciplinary effort of developmental biologists for sample preparation and data interpretation, X-ray physicists for planning and performing the experiment and applied mathematicians/computer scientists/physicists for data processing and analysis. Sample preparation requires 9–48 h, depending on the stage of development to be studied. Data acquisition takes 2–3 h per tomographic time-lapse sequence. Data processing and analysis requires a further 2 weeks, depending on the availability of computing power and the amount of detail required to address a given scientific problem.},

These constraints can be overcome by an imaging probe that has sensitivity to soft tissue, the ability to penetrate opaque surfaces, and high spatial and temporal resolution. Synchrotron X-ray imaging has been successfully used to visualize millimeter-centimeter-sized organisms with micrometer-range spatial resolutions in fixed and living specimens. Synchrotron imaging of small organisms has been the key to recent novel insights into structure and function, particularly in the area of respiratory physiology and function of insects. X-ray imaging has been effectively used to examine the morphology of tracheal systems, the mechanisms of tracheal and air sac compression in insects, and the function of both chewing and sucking mouthparts in insects. Synchrotron X-ray imaging provides an exciting new window into the internal workings of small animals, with future promise to contribute to a range of physiological and biomechanical questions in comparative biology.},

The object is rotated about an axis at right angles to the direction of a parallel beam of radiation, and sections of it normal to the axis are reconstructed from data obtained by scanning the corresponding linear strips in the shadowgraphs at different angular settings.Since the formulae in the convolution method involve only summations over one variable at a time, while a two-dimensional reconstruction with the Fourier transform technique requires double summations, the convolution method is much faster (typically by a factor of 30); the relative increase in speed is larger where greater resolution is required. Tests of the convolution method with computer-simulated shadowgraphs show that it is also more accurate than the Fourier transform method. It has good potentialities for application in electron microscopy and x-radiography. A new method of reconstructing helical structures by this technique is also suggested.},

The spatial distribution of bubble size depends on the effect of individual coalescence events on the bubble size distribution, the rate at which they occur, and the rise rate of the bubbles. The film rupture rate is assumed to depend on the film area and the film drainage time, and is calculated using several simple models. This analysis agrees well with measurements conducted in a laboratory foam cell. However, the time-scale of the experiments indicated that film drainage was occurring predominantly in the hydrodynamic regime, and that non-equilibrium rupture mechanisms were primarily responsible for the observed coalescence. },

Monochromatic radiation, high spatial resolution down to the micrometer scale, partial beam coherence, and holographicreconstruction techniques permit the distinction between different foam constituents which are not visible by other volume imaging techniques. In combination with three-dimensional image analysis, the differences in the pore initiation processes in two different aluminium alloys are shown. We find that, in powder compacts made from prealloyed AA6061 alloy powder, pores appear predominantly around the blowing agent particles whereas, in compacts made from a powder blend of Al and Si, pores tend to initiate around Si particles.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms behind pore formation in aluminium alloys that are in commercial use for making foam components are still not understood. It is accepted that they play a key role in the quality of the evolving pore structure. In order to shed light on early pore formation, aluminium foams in low expansion stages made by the powder-compact melting process were investigated by synchrotron-based hard X-ray microtomography and quantitative image analysis. The calculated spatial correlation functions between the gas source (TiH2 particles) and the nucleating pores show that the location of pore formation and the spatial gas source distribution for AlSi7 and Al–Si–Cu alloys are essentially independent. Therefore, in the alloys investigated, the position of the melt formation is found to determine the pore nucleation rather than the spatial distribution of TiH2. This behaviour explains the known positive effect on the pore structure achieved by adding copper. },

Coalescence events can be identified as discontinuities in a spatio-temporal image representing a sequence of projection images. Detection, identification of intensity and localization of the discontinuities exploit a violation criterion of the Fourier shift theorem and are based on recursive spatio-temporal image partitioning. The proposed method is suited for automated measurements of discontinuity rates (i.e., discontinuity intensity per unit time), so that large series of radiographs can be analyzed without user intervention. The application potential is demonstrated by the quantification of coalescence during the formation and decay of metal foams monitored by real-time x-ray radiography.},

For them, analysis in terms of the "relative operating characteristic" of signal detection theory provides a precise and valid measure of diagnostic accuracy. It is the only measure available that is uninfluenced by decision biases and prior probabilities, and it places the performances of diverse systems on a common, easily interpreted scale. Representative values of this measure are reported here for systems in medical imaging, materials testing, weather forecasting, information retrieval, polygraph lie detection, and aptitude testing. Though the measure itself is sound, the values obtained from tests of diagnostic systems often require qualification because the test data on which they are based are of unsure quality. A common set of problems in testing is faced in all fields. How well these problems are handled, or can be handled in a given field, determines the degree of confidence that can be placed in a measured value of accuracy. Some fields fare much better than others.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of optical flow estimation algorithms has been improving steadily as evidenced by results on the Middlebury optical flow benchmark. The typical formulation, however, has changed little since the work of Horn and Schunck. We attempt to uncover what has made recent advances possible through a thorough analysis of how the objective function, the optimization method, and modern implementation practices influence accuracy. We discover that “classical” flow formulations perform surprisingly well when combined with modern optimization and implementation techniques. One key implementation detail is the median filtering of intermediate flow fields during optimization. While this improves the robustness of classical methods it actually leads to higher energy solutions, meaning that these methods are not optimizing the original objective function. To understand the principles behind this phenomenon, we derive a new objective function that formalizes the median filtering heuristic. This objective function includes a non-local smoothness term that robustly integrates flow estimates over large spatial neighborhoods. By modifying this new term to include information about flow and image boundaries we develop a method that can better preserve motion details. To take advantage of the trend towards video in wide-screen format, we further introduce an asymmetric pyramid downsampling scheme that enables the estimation of longer range horizontal motions. The methods are evaluated on the Middlebury, MPI Sintel, and KITTI datasets using the same parameter settings.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Optical flow is a key method used for quantitative motion estimation of biological structures in light microscopy. It has also been used as a key module in segmentation and tracking systems and is considered a mature technology in the field of computer vision. However, most of the research focused on 2D natural images, which are small in size and rich in edges and texture information. In contrast, 3D time-lapse recordings of biological specimens comprise up to several terabytes of image data and often exhibit complex object dynamics as well as blurring due to the point-spread-function of the microscope. Thus, new approaches to optical flow are required to improve performance for such data.Results: We solve optical flow in large 3D time-lapse microscopy datasets by defining a Markov random field (MRF) over super-voxels in the foreground and applying motion smoothness constraints between super-voxels instead of voxel-wise. This model is tailored to the specific characteristics of light microscopy datasets: super-voxels help registration in textureless areas, the MRF over super-voxels efficiently propagates motion information between neighboring cells and the background subtraction and super-voxels reduce the dimensionality of the problem by an order of magnitude. We validate our approach on large 3D time-lapse datasets of Drosophila and zebrafish development by analyzing cell motion patterns. We show that our approach is, on average, 10 × faster than commonly used optical flow implementations in the Insight Tool-Kit (ITK) and reduces the average flow end point error by 50% in regions with complex dynamic processes, such as cell divisions.Availability: Source code freely available in the Software section at http://janelia.org/lab/keller-lab.Contact: amatf@janelia.hhmi.org or kellerp@janelia.hhmi.orgSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{Kastrinaki03,
  abstract = {Video sensors become particularly important in traffic applications mainly due to their fast response, easy installation, operation and maintenance, and their ability to monitor wide areas. Research in several fields of traffic applications has resulted in a wealth of video processing and analysis methods. Two of the most demanding and widely studied applications relate to traffic monitoring and automatic vehicle guidance. In general, systems developed for these areas must integrate, amongst their other tasks, the analysis of their static environment (automatic lane finding) and the detection of static or moving obstacles (object detection) within their space of interest. In this paper we present an overview of image processing and analysis tools used in these applications and we relate these tools with complete systems developed for specific traffic applications. More specifically, we categorize processing methods based on the intrinsic organization of their input data (feature-driven, area-driven, or model-based) and the domain of processing (spatial/frame or temporal/video). Furthermore, we discriminate between the cases of static and mobile camera. Based on this categorization of processing tools, we present representative systems that have been deployed for operation. Thus, the purpose of the paper is threefold. First, to classify image-processing methods used in traffic applications. Second, to provide the advantages and disadvantages of these algorithms. Third, from this integrated consideration, to attempt an evaluation of shortcomings and general needs in this field of active research. },

It has a wide spectrum of promising applications, including access control in special areas, human identification at a distance, crowd flux statistics and congestion analysis, detection of anomalous behaviors, and interactive surveillance using multiple cameras, etc. In general, the processing framework of visual surveillance in dynamic scenes includes the following stages: modeling of environments, detection of motion, classification of moving objects, tracking, understanding and description of behaviors, human identification, and fusion of data from multiple cameras. We review recent developments and general strategies of all these stages. Finally, we analyze possible research directions, e.g., occlusion handling, a combination of twoand three-dimensional tracking, a combination of motion analysis and biometrics, anomaly detection and behavior prediction, content-based retrieval of surveillance videos, behavior understanding and natural language description, fusion of information from multiple sensors, and remote surveillance.},

  abstract = {A new approach to automatic annotation of video sequences by dominant camera motion interpretation is presented. Unlike other approaches, we separate the optical flow into two categories—singularandnon-singular—which, as we show, is a more natural way of classification for the purpose ofdominantcamera motion interpretation. We show that identification of patterns created by such natural categories, which can be observed from themeasuredoptical flow, can help focus the interpretation ofdominantcamera motion in video segments. For robust detection of such natural patterns, we propose the computation of optical flow streams (OFS) from the video data and analyze the \{OFS\} for the extraction of dominant motion content in the video segments. The advantage of the proposed approach is its robustness in the extraction of dominant motion content in a video segment. We demonstrate this on a variety of real video sequences by generating the automatic motion annotation of the video frames and comparing it with manual motion annotation. },

We primarily focus on optical measurement techniques for in vivo applications, such as laser Doppler velocimetry (including time varying speckle), laser speckle contrast imaging and particle image velocimetry (including particle tracking). We also briefly describe nuclear magnetic resonance and ultrasound particle image velocimetry, two techniques that do not rely on optical access, but that are of importance to in vivo whole-field blood velocity measurement. Typical applications for whole-field methods are perfusion monitoring, the investigation of instantaneous blood flow patterns, the derivation of endothelial shear stress distributions from velocity fields, and the measurement of blood volume flow rates. These applications require individual treatment in terms of spatial and temporal resolution and number of measured velocity components. The requirements further differ for the investigation of macro-, meso-, and microscale blood flows. In this review we describe and classify those requirements and present techniques that satisfy them.},

  abstract = {The problem of respiratory motion has proved a serious obstacle in developing techniques to acquire images or guide interventions in abdominal and thoracic organs. Motion models offer a possible solution to these problems, and as a result the field of respiratory motion modelling has become an active one over the past 15&#xa0;years. A motion model can be defined as a process that takes some surrogate data as input and produces a motion estimate as output. Many techniques have been proposed in the literature, differing in the data used to form the models, the type of model employed, how this model is computed, the type of surrogate data used as input to the model in order to make motion estimates and what form this output should take. In addition, a wide range of different application areas have been proposed. In this paper we summarise the state of the art in this important field and in the process highlight the key papers that have driven its advance. The intention is that this will serve as a timely review and comparison of the different techniques proposed to date and as a basis to inform future research in this area. },

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

In this paper, we will present a novel parametrization for multi-frame optical flow computation that naturally enables us to embed the assumption of a temporally coherent spatial flow structure, as well as the assumption that the optical flow is smooth along motion trajectories. While the first assumption is realized by expanding spatial regularization over multiple frames, the second assumption is imposed by two novel first- and second-order trajectorial smoothness terms. With respect to the latter, we investigate an adaptive decision scheme that makes a local (per pixel) or global (per sequence) selection of the most appropriate model possible. Experiments show the clear superiority of our approach when compared to existing strategies for imposing temporal coherence. Moreover, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method by achieving Top 3 results at the widely used Middlebury benchmark.},

The difficulty is to avoid the smoothing of edges, which are very important attributes of the image. The authors first give sufficient conditions for the design of such an edge-preserving regularization. Under these conditions, it is possible to introduce an auxiliary variable whose role is twofold. Firstly, it marks the discontinuities and ensures their preservation from smoothing. Secondly, it makes the criterion half-quadratic. The optimization is then easier. The authors propose a deterministic strategy, based on alternate minimizations on the image and the auxiliary variable. This yields two algorithms, ARTUR and LEGEND.

In Part A of the present paper the problem which is solved is the inversion of this linear functional transformation, that is the following questions are answered: can every line function satisfying suitable regularity conditions be regarded as constructed in this way? If so, is f uniquely known from F and how can f be calculated? In Part B a solution of the dual problem of calculating a line function F(g) from its point mean values f(P) is solved in a certain sense. Finally, in Part C certain generalizations are discussed, prompted by consideration of non-Euclidean manifolds as well as higher dimensional spaces. The treatment of these problems, themselves of interest, gains enhanced importance through the numerous relationships that exist between this topic and the theory of logarithmic and Newtonian potentials. These are mentioned at appropriate places in the text.},
